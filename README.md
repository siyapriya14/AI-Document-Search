# AI Document Search using RAG

This project is an AI-powered Document Search application built using
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
Users can upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload PDF documents dynamically
- Ask questions from uploaded documents
- Uses RAG architecture for accurate answers
- Built with Streamlit for UI
- FAISS for vector storage
- HuggingFace embeddings

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- FAISS
- HuggingFace Sentence Transformers

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the streamlit app

---

## 📄 How It Works (RAG Flow)
1. User uploads a PDF document
2. Document is split into chunks
3. Embeddings are generated using HuggingFace
4. FAISS stores vectors
5. Relevant chunks are retrieved
6. LLM generates answer from retrieved context
